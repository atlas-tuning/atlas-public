# Atlas
Atlas is a free, open-source ECU calibration application made for reverse-engineering and recalibrating modern vehicles. This project started as an effort to better understand the behavior of the 2022 WRX ECU but, as there is a lack of free and maintained tooling for software engineers and auto enthusiasts to gain first-party access to their ECUs, has since pivoted towards adopting a much broader feature set that encourages modern ECU research, recalibration and modification.

## Features
### Comprehensive Tuning Suite:
* Enables in-depth ECU research, leading to full recalibration capabilities
* Supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS (including M-series), and Linux (including SteamOS and Raspbian), leveraging Java and open-source libraries
* Integrates the Ghidra SRE Framework bundle to analyze tables and emulate ROM machine code

### Versatile Connectivity:
* Supports the Tactrix OpenPort 2.0 via direct serial/COM connection with a natively-written driver in Atlas

### Advanced Visualization and Editing:
* Provides 2D and 3D OpenGL visualizations for gauges, tables, and function charts
* Offers a 1-2 dimension table editor with common arithmetic functions for efficient calibration editing
* Includes a live table definition interface to manage project tables and expedite table definition
* Features a value scaling configuration UI to rapidly create new scaling operations as they are identified within ECU logic

### Comprehensive Documentation and Diagnostics:
* Allows customization of memory parameters to notate ECU RAM offsets corresponding to specific metrics (e.g., RPM, Requested Torque, etc.)
* Provides a simple node graph to create and browse documentation of ECU behavior
* Includes gauges and a data logger for calibration diagnostics and troubleshooting, with project configuration and CSV export capabilities

### Streamlined Project Management:
* Offers a composite project system that consolidates all calibrations and ECU configurations in a single file
* Features an intelligent table-matching system to automatically detect new tables and discover existing tables in unknown variants
* Enables a consistent experience across model years and variants with an intelligent calibration cross-application function

## WARNING!

There are several disclaimers worth stating, in regards to your use of Atlas:
* Messing with your ECU is dangerous. You can "brick" or permenantly ruin an ECU by improperly instructing it to perform routines or flashing incompatible calibrations. The project recommends that users consult with a professional mechanic or tuner before making any ECU modifications. Use of the project's software tools is at the user's own risk.
* Improperly modifying your ECU calibration (Target Boost, Ignition Timing, Mass Airflow Calibration, Wastegate Duty Cycle, Rev Limiter, Volumetric Efficiency, etc.) can directly damage your vehicles engine. This project and its contributors will not be held responsible for any damage to the engine or other vehicle components that may result from the use of these tools. Modifying a car's ECU tune can be complex and risky, and should only be attempted by experienced users.
* In many cases, ECU access can lead to exposing calibrations for regulated systems such as emissions-related features of a vehicle. This project will not provide definitions to recalibrate any legally regulated systems (TGV, EGR, P0420, etc.). By using Atlas, you agree to use Atlas in a legal manner that abides by all laws local to you regarding these systems and their regulated calibration. Please see our [emissions statement](./emissions.html) for more information.
