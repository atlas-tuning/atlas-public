## Warnings
* Messing with your ECU is dangerous. You can "brick" or permenantly ruin an ECU by improperly instructing it to perform routines or flashing incompatible calibrations. The project recommends that users consult with a professional mechanic or tuner before making any ECU modifications. Use of the project's software tools is at the user's own risk.
* Improperly modifying your ECU calibration (Target Boost, Ignition Timing, Mass Airflow Calibration, Wastegate Duty Cycle, Rev Limiter, Volumetric Efficiency, etc.) can directly damage your vehicles engine. This project and its contributors will not be held responsible for any damage to the engine or other vehicle components that may result from the use of these tools. Modifying a car's ECU tune can be complex and risky, and should only be attempted by experienced users.

## Emissions
* In many cases, ECU access can lead to exposing calibrations for regulated systems such as emissions-related features of a vehicle. This project will not provide definitions to recalibrate any legally regulated systems (TGV, EGR, P0420, etc.).
* The Atlas software package is intended for the legal and responsible modification of a vehicle’s ECU calibration. It is essential that users of Atlas adhere strictly to emissions regulations to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and maintain the viability of this community resource.
* North American Motorsports Research does not condone, support, or facilitate the removal or tampering of any emissions-regulated components from a vehicle. This includes, but is not limited to, components such as the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, Tumble Generator Valve (TGV), and catalytic converters.
* North American Motorsports Research is committed to operating within the bounds of U.S. emissions laws and regulations as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other relevant authorities. The removal or modification of emissions-regulated components is strictly prohibited under the Clean Air Act, as well as other pertinent federal laws, including but not limited to:

> - The Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.)
> - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) (42 U.S.C. § 7412)
> - Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act (42 U.S.C. § 7521 et seq.)
> - Energy Policy Act (42 U.S.C. § 13201 et seq.)

* Non-compliance with these legal requirements could jeopardize the existence of Atlas and other similar projects. North American Motorsports Research is dedicated to enabling vehicle enthusiasts to tune their vehicles responsibly, ensuring both environmental responsibility and full legal compliance. Users are urged to familiarize themselves with and adhere to all relevant emissions regulations to support the continued success and legality of Atlas.
* By using Atlas, you agree to comply with all applicable emissions regulations and acknowledge that any illegal modifications to emissions-controlled components are strictly prohibited.
