title: "Fast Flash Support"
---

With a revamped flash protocol leveraging a new flashing strategy, Atlas now supports fast flashing! This means dramatically reduced flash times with [supported adapters]({{ '/support.html' | absolute_url }}).

Flashing an adjustment to the calibration can now take as little as 10 seconds! This feature is fully supported on the FA24 powered VB WRX. We're currently investigating support viability for the VA chassis.

Additionally, the NAMR team is hard at work to support live tuning and real-time table editing. Real-time tuning and calibration is an important tool that can dramatically reduce time spent datalogging and tune evaluation.
