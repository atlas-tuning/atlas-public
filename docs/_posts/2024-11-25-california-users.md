After a thorough review of the laws and regulations regarding emissions compliance, we've unfortunately concluded that we cannot support users in the State of California that wish to reprogram their vehicles.

Atlas is intended for the legal and responsible modification of a vehicle's ECU calibration. It is essential that users of Atlas strictly adhere to emissions regulations to ensure compliance with all applicable laws in order to maintain the viability of this community resource.

Atlas can still be installed by Californian users and they can still utilize any other unrelated features of Atlas, but due to the strict emissions regulations imposed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), Atlas will prevent any attempt to flash Californian vehicles.

We understand how frustrating this news will be and we apologize that we're not able to support this functionality. Unfortunately we have determined that a 49-state solution is the only option that we can implement at this time.
