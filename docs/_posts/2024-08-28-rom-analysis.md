title: "Automatic table matching and ROM analysis"
---

Despite the most popular functionality of Atlas being performance tuning and engine calibration customization, from its conception, Atlas was always envisioned to be a fully featured ECU analysis and management platform.

Today we're proud to announce support for automatic ROM analytics! Using the same robust SRE integration we use for in-suite ECU emulation, Atlas now supports automatic table discovery and matching with subroutine and function detection.

This means we'll be able to fast-track support for new factory calibrations (CAL IDs) as well as entirely new vehicles and a broader representation of market variants! Instead of painstakingly reverse engineering a ROM from scratch, Atlas can do it for you!
Everything from the location of VE tables and gear ratios to timing and MAF scaling can be detected and defined automatically within Atlas.


This represents a major leap forward for aftermarket tuning and engine recalibration. To our knowledge, Atlas is the first software suite in it's class to combine both an automatic ROM analyzer with an intuitive tune editor and ECU flash tool.

As a result of this development, the Atlas project is now able to accelerate our support efforts for both the FA20 powered VA chassis WRX (2014-2021) as well as the VB chassis WRX featuring the FA24 power plant for model year 2024 and beyond.
