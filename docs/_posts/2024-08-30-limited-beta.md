title: "Beta testing begins!"
---

It's been a long road getting from there to here, but we feel that Atlas has sufficiently matured and is now ready to begin beta testing!

During this end-user evaluation stage, we will be working closely with a small group of industry professionals, amateur tuners, track day addicts and Subaru enthusiasts to refine and adjust Atlas in order to deliver a truly "Grade A" product.

We anticipate that this beta phase will last two weeks (September 1st through the 14th) but may extend this period, depending on user feedback, if additional time is assessed to implement any potential changes.

Beta participation is subject to approval and is limited to individuals who meet the following criteria:

* Owners of a Subaru WRX, model year 2022 or 2023, equipped with either a WRX (TY75) or STI (TY85) 6-speed manual transmission
* Owners of a [supported OpenPort adapter](https://motorsportsresearch.org/support.html)
* Individuals comfortable with ECU flashing, engine modification, calibration tweaks and adjusting engine sensor calibrations, fueling, airflow and other associated tables and values
* Individuals willing to provide frequent and detailed feedback

It's important to note that this is a pre-release beta evaluation and while we're extremely confident that Atlas will perform admirably, we can't guarantee that Atlas will be entirely error free. Because of this, beta participants should carefully consider and be willing to accept any potential risks involved in the modification of their vehicle's software and engine calibration.

User feedback is incredibly important to us and we will be working hard over the next two weeks to incorporate new improvements and implement any potential bug fixes.
We are extremely excited to enter this phase of development and, although we have yet to determine a specific date, are eagerly looking forward to a public release this fall!
