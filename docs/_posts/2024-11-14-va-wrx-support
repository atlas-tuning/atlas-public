title: "VA Chassis WRX Support"
---

Compatibility with the previous generation of WRX was by far one of our most popular requests, and despite it's beginnings as a VB WRX (2022-present) specific tuning platform, Atlas now [supports](https://docs.motorsportsresearch.org/books/atlas-documentation/page/supported-vehicles) tuning, datalogging and flashing for the VA chassis (2015-2021) WRX!

With this development, the powerful Atlas tuning studio now supports the majority of "modern" USDM Subaru WRX models. Gone are the days of locked tunes and restrictive hardware options. The barrier of entry for professional performance tuning is now as low as the cost of a [supported adapter](https://docs.motorsportsresearch.org/books/atlas-documentation/page/supported-adapters) and your own computer!
